# SwitchingBsubtilis

This is part of MSc Systems Biology course, University of Cambridge, 2022/2023, carried out over 6 months.

The file details are listed below

Method1: Data processing 

1. #Part 1: basic data processing - import data into two data frames, clean (end + base removed), and visualisation 
2. #Part 2: focused data processing - plotting the movement of the front with several front thresholds and maximum signals of YFP or RFP

Method2: single cell IRL-ODE model

#Part 1: create model

#Part 2: run both deterministic and stochastic ODE and visualisation

#Part 3: IRL-ODE parameterisation - scanning binding constants using analytical solution for finding RSS values and eigenvalues (with additional R codes for plotting bifurcation diagram) 

Method3: biofilm level NuBac-PDE model

#Part 1: create model

#Part 2: run deterministic PDE and visualisation

#Part 3: PDE parameterisation - scanning the diffusion coefficient of bacteria (Db) using loss function of the front movement difference
